# Net Neutrality Game Show

## Statement of Purpose
Democracy can only thrive where its citizens are sufficiently informed to make
sound decisions. If America really wants to be leaders in Democracy, we should
lead by example. Our leadership can be a national project that every American
and person around the globe can participate in, a local, national and eventually
global YouTube Live gameseries. The series shall begin with the currently
important topic of Net Neutrality. We shall start with a simple game show and
eventually we shall evolve into a globally collaborative game. 

## Games
### Forming Games
1. All of the people who want to play a game during the show make it known that
they want to play.
2. All of the people who want to ask a question make it known they want to ask
a question.
### The Zero Game
#### Roles
* The Participant
* The Questioner
* The Scorekeeper

#### Game Mechanics
1. At the start of Zero, the order of the signup is in the order of the turns.
2c. If the question is answered correctly, player advances to the next round.
2w. If the answer is out of bounds, the player is done for the game.
3. Keep repeating 1 through 2 for each next person in line until everyone in
line has gone.
5. When everyone has gone, repeat from the beginning with the remaining players.
6. Play until everyone is out or nobody has gotten out for a certain number of
turns.
7. If the whole group has stayed in for a round, the group may wager how many
more rounds they believe the group can stay in.
8c. A correct wager is a win.
8w. A wrong wager is a loss.

#### Score Keeping
* A player's score is the round number reached.
* The team score is the percentage of players who made it to the end. 
* A player also has a percent justified with evidence.
* A team also has a percent justified with evidence.

If you know enough English to answer the question correctly, you should play.
If you know enough to ask a question correctly, you should ask a question.

## Translating Subtitles
Currently we only have mostly English speaking volunteers. We would eventually
like to do this in every language, but currently English is the only one we are
able to offer. If you speak another language and would like to be involved in
helping translate for participants in other languages or would like to run and
alternate language show, feel free to reach out to us at
[info@instamarch.org.](mailto:info@instamarch.org).

## Questions and Answers
The questions relate to the knowledge one needs to be informed about Net
Neutrality. Questions and answers may be proposed and/or added with a pull
request. If you need help making a pull request, we are glad to help.  Decisions
around what questions we add and reject shall be public. All of our work is
open source. Eventually we shall formalize the process of adding questions and
answers, but they should include every point of view.
